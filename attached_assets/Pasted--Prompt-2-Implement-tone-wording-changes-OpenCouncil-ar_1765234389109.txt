## 🎨 Prompt 2 — Implement *tone & wording* changes (“OpenCouncil archive” instead of “your documents”)

```text
You are editing the same OpenCouncil municipal assistant codebase. Your goal is to clean up the language so it is professional, neutral, and product-branded — **never** blaming the user or implying they did something wrong with “your documents”.

Replace “your documents” style wording with “OpenCouncil archive” style wording, and update all scope / disclaimer text accordingly.

### 1) Find and replace problematic phrases

Search the codebase (especially answer templates, system prompts, and error handlers) for phrases like:

- "your documents"
- "the provided documents"
- "your town documents"
- "we don't have your docs"
- "we don't have your documents"
- "I couldn't generate a response."
- "based ONLY on the provided documents"
- Any similar second-person document ownership phrasing

You are **not** removing the constraints (the system must still be doc-grounded when appropriate), just changing how this is communicated.

### 2) Introduce standardized “source scope” snippets

Implement three reusable scope description strings somewhere central (e.g., a `scopes.ts` module or constants file), and then reuse them in answer synthesis and error handlers.

#### A) Local / municipal doc-based scope

```ts
const LOCAL_SCOPE_NOTE = 
  "Source scope: Based on documents available in the OpenCouncil archive for this municipality. " +
  "These materials include meeting minutes, budgets, warrant articles, town reports, or policy records where available. " +
  "Details may be incomplete depending on what municipalities have published or digitized.";
Use this whenever the answer is clearly based on one specific town’s municipal documents (budget, minutes, etc.).

B) Statewide / RSA-based scope
ts
Copy code
const STATEWIDE_SCOPE_NOTE =
  "Source scope: Informed primarily by New Hampshire statutory and regulatory context. " +
  "This summary is not based on a specific municipality’s OpenCouncil-indexed documents. " +
  "For exact legal language or application, consult the official RSA text or municipal counsel. " +
  "This information is informational only and is not legal advice.";
Use this when the answer is a general explanation of New Hampshire law / RSA (for example, the RSA 53-A summary path implemented in Prompt 1).

C) General fallback scope (no relevant docs found)
ts
Copy code
const NO_DOC_SCOPE_NOTE =
  "Source scope: No directly relevant material was found in the OpenCouncil archive for this question. " +
  "Where possible, this response reflects general New Hampshire municipal practice. " +
  "Local procedures may differ, and consulting municipal records or counsel may provide more specific guidance. " +
  "This information is informational only and is not legal advice.";
Use this when:

There were no matching municipal documents, and

The answer had to be constructed from general patterns/knowledge, or

You are explicitly telling the user that OpenCouncil couldn’t find anything on that topic.

3) Update prompts and templates to use this wording
A) Complex answer synthesis
Find the complex-answer synthesizer (look for system prompt: “You are an expert municipal governance assistant for New Hampshire…”, and sections like “### At a glance / ### Key numbers / ### Details from recent meetings”).

At the end of the answer assembly pipeline (after generating the content), append either:

LOCAL_SCOPE_NOTE if at least one municipal snippet was used and townPreference is set.

STATEWIDE_SCOPE_NOTE if the answer is primarily statute/state-level.

NO_DOC_SCOPE_NOTE if no snippets were available and you are answering from general knowledge.

Make the choice based on the same scopeHint and snippet usage already available from Prompt 1.

B) Simple answer path
In the simple-answer function:

If resultCount > 0 and a specific town is implied:

Append LOCAL_SCOPE_NOTE.

If it’s an RSA / statewide answer (no docs, but isRSAQuestion === true as implemented in Prompt 1):

Append STATEWIDE_SCOPE_NOTE.

If neither docs nor RSA-state context are present (pure “no results” from OpenCouncil):

Use NO_DOC_SCOPE_NOTE and a short, professional explanation like:

text
Copy code
No directly relevant material was found in the OpenCouncil archive for this question. 
The following general guidance may still be helpful, but local procedures can differ.
Replace any “I apologize, but I couldn’t generate a response.” type messages with this more professional pattern.

C) System prompts and guidance text
Update system prompts where you see wording like:

“Answer questions based ONLY on the provided documents”

“If information is not in the documents, clearly state that…”

Change them to explicitly mention OpenCouncil archives, for example:

text
Copy code
Answer questions based on documents indexed in the OpenCouncil archive (municipal budgets, minutes, town reports, ordinances, etc.). 
When a clear, document-based answer is not possible, either:
- Explain that no directly relevant material was found in the OpenCouncil archive, and/or
- Provide carefully labeled general guidance based on New Hampshire practice or law, with an explicit scope note.
All information is informational only and not legal advice.
Ensure no system prompt uses “your documents” or implies that the user personally provided the docs.

4) Keep tone polished and neutral
Where you previously might have said:

"We don't have your documents."

"Your documents don't cover this."

Change to formulations like:

"No directly relevant material appears in the OpenCouncil archive for this question."

"The available documents for this municipality do not address this question directly."

These should appear in:

Error states

Edge-case answers

Any fallback explanation when the archive lacks coverage

5) Sanity check
Once you update everything, ensure that:

Answers now end with one of the three standardized scope notes.

The RSA 53-A question path uses STATEWIDE_SCOPE_NOTE.

Town-specific questions show LOCAL scope notes.

Fallbacks never blame the user or mention “your documents.”

Keep the implementation consistent with existing coding style (TypeScript types, logging patterns, etc.).
