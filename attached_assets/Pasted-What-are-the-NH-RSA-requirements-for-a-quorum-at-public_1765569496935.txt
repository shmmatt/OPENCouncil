What are the NH RSA requirements for a quorum at public meetings?

2:56:32 PM

Based on New Hampshire State Law (RSA 91-A, the "Right-to-Know" Law) and specific rules adopted by Ossipee boards, here are the requirements for public meetings.

1. Quorum Requirements
A quorum is the minimum number of members who must be present to conduct business.

General Rule: RSA 91-A defines a quorum as a simple majority of the board's membership (e.g., 3 members of a 5-member board).
Physical Presence: A quorum must be physically present at the meeting location. Remote participation by a member is only allowed if a quorum is already physically present at the site (unless there is a declared state of emergency).
Ossipee Planning Board: The Rules of Procedure (Amended July 2024) specifically require 4 members to be present to constitute a quorum for their 7-member board.
2. Public Input & Decorum Rules (Ossipee Specific)
While the public has a right to attend and record meetings, the right to speak is limited to designated times (Public Comment) or Public Hearings. Ossipee boards have adopted strict rules regarding this:

Selectmen’s Public Input Policy (Adopted June 2022):
Time Limit: Speakers are limited to 3 minutes each.
Total Time: The total public comment period is capped at 15 minutes.
Identification: Speakers must identify themselves by name and address and speak from the podium.
Scope: The Chair is not required to allow public comment during general board discussion, only during the specific "Public Comment" agenda item or hearings.
Planning Board Conduct Rules:
Prohibited Items: Banners, flyers, and signs are not permitted in the meeting room.
Directing Comments: All comments must be directed to the Board, not to other audience members.
Disruption: The Chair has the authority to remove individuals who are boisterous or refuse to follow directives.
3. Meeting Notice & Minutes
Notice:
Regular Meetings: Must be posted at least 24 hours in advance (excluding Sundays and holidays) in two public places (e.g., Town Hall, Town website).
Land Use Hearings (Planning/Zoning): Often require 10 days notice including certified mail to abutters (RSA 676:4).
Minutes:
Availability: Minutes must be available for public inspection within 5 business days of the meeting (RSA 91-A:2).
Content: Must include names of members, persons appearing before the board, a brief description of the subject matter, and all decisions/votes.
Recordings: The Ossipee Planning Board Rules state that audio recordings are deleted 30 days after approval of the written minutes (which become the official record).
4. Voting Rules
Open Voting: All votes must be public.
No Secret Ballots: Secret ballots are strictly prohibited by NH law.
Roll Call: A roll call vote is often required, particularly when entering a non-public session or when members are participating remotely.
